# Job Preparation

### Brea Clark

## Self Assessment

Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?
* I would like to have a portfolio website that showcases my best work and itself shows my skills. I think having this match the style of my resume would look professional and establish a sort of brand. It also might be good to have some cards printed for job fairs. I should also finish my cover letter.

Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?
* I'm not a great networker, and I would like to be better at it. I also stumble over my words a lot when I'm nervous. I like the suggestion to draft a lightning talk and plan to give it somewhere soon.

* Brainstorm lightning talk topics
* Write a talk
* Research places to give the talk

  * ~~Add jquery/css animations~~
    * ~~Nice scroll~~
    * ~~Top buttons underlined when on section~~
  * ~~Put in about text~~

## Reflection & Next Steps

Do you feel like you made improvement today? Are you more confident and comfortable in one or more areas? Why or why not?
* Yes, I feel more confident having a portfolio website ready to show people.

Where are you at now? What are your next steps? What do you still need to accomplish to feel confident and prepared to begin your eventual job search?
* I still need to get cards printed and work on a talk, though this was something I anticipated I wouldn't finish today anyways. I'll probably work on that this weekend.
