# Job Preparation

## Self Assessment

Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?
* I would like to have a portfolio website that showcases my best work and itself shows my skills. I think having this match the style of my resume would look professional and establish a sort of brand. It also might be good to have some cards printed for job fairs.

Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?
* I'm not a great networker, and I would like to be better at it. I also stumble over my words a lot when I'm nervous. I like the suggestion to draft a lightning talk and plan to give it somewhere soon.
